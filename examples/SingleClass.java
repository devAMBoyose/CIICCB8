// File: HelloWorld.java
// A simple .java file that contains only one public class, which must match the filename.
// This is the most common and standard way of writing a Java file.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}

/*The filename HelloWorld.java must match the public class name HelloWorld.
The compiler creates a .class file named HelloWorld.class after compilation.
This is the basic structure used in most Java programs. */
